# ScriptSplitter

## Split your scripts into smaller ones!
The original `rmmz_xxx.js` files are terrible to read. With this plugin, one
can easily split the source into smaller ones.

1. Enable the plugin and run the project. The splitted scripts will be saved in
    corresponding directories, i.e., `js/rmmz_core/001_Utils.js`.
2. Remember to disable the plugin once you have split the scripts.
3. Replace the `main.js` with the one in this repo to correctly run the splitted
    scripts correctly.

Have fun!
